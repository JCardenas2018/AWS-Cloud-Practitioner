# 🌎 AWS Regions

## 📌 What is an AWS Region?

An **AWS Region** is a **geographically isolated** area where AWS provides **a group of Availability Zones (AZs)**. Each region is designed to be **completely independent** from others to ensure the **highest fault tolerance and stability**.

> **Purpose**: To allow customers to deploy applications and store data close to their users, while meeting compliance, redundancy, and performance requirements.

## 🧠 Key Characteristics

| Feature                     | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Geographically isolated** | Each region is located in a separate global location                        |
| **Contains multiple AZs**   | Each region includes at least two Availability Zones (usually 3 or more)   |
| **Service availability**    | Not all AWS services are available in every region                          |
| **Data residency**          | Allows compliance with data sovereignty and residency requirements          |
| **Latency optimization**    | Choose the region closest to your users to reduce latency                   |

## ⚙️ Region Selection Considerations

- **Latency**: Choose regions closer to your user base
- **Compliance**: Some workloads must reside in specific countries (e.g., GDPR in Europe)
- **Service Availability**: Some AWS services are not available in all regions
- **Cost**: Pricing can vary from one region to another

## 🧱 AWS Infrastructure Comparison

| Component           | Description                                                | Example            |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| **Region**          | Geographical area with multiple AZs                        | `us-east-1`        |
| **Availability Zone** | Isolated data center within a region                      | `us-east-1a`       |
| **Edge Location**   | CDN node used for caching and low-latency content delivery | New York Edge PoP  |
