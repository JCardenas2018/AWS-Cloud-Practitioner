# Amazon S3 Storage Classes Explained with Clear Examples

Amazon S3 offers a range of **storage classes** to optimize cost depending on **access frequency**, **retention duration**, **retrieval speed**, and **resiliency**.

Here are the main S3 Storage Classes with clear use cases and examples:

---

## ✅ 1. S3 Standard

- **Use**: Frequently accessed data.
- High availability (99.99%) and durability (99.999999999%).
- No retrieval charges.

📦 **Example**: Product images, CSS, and JavaScript files for a web application accessed daily.

```json
"StorageClass": "STANDARD"
```

---

## ✅ 2. S3 Intelligent-Tiering

- **Use**: Unpredictable access patterns.
- Automatically moves objects between tiers (frequent, infrequent, archive) based on usage.
- Small monitoring cost per object.

📦 **Example**: User-uploaded documents where access frequency varies.

```json
"StorageClass": "INTELLIGENT_TIERING"
```

---

## ✅ 3. S3 Standard-IA (Infrequent Access)

- **Use**: Infrequently accessed, but quick to retrieve.
- Cheaper than Standard, but retrieval fees apply.

📦 **Example**: Monthly backups or older log files.

```json
"StorageClass": "STANDARD_IA"
```

---

## ✅ 4. S3 One Zone-IA

- Same as Standard-IA, but data is stored in a **single Availability Zone**.
- Cheaper but less resilient.

📦 **Example**: Temporary or easily reproducible files.

```json
"StorageClass": "ONEZONE_IA"
```

---

## ✅ 5. S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval

- For rarely accessed data that needs **instant access (milliseconds)**.
- Cheaper than Standard-IA.

📦 **Example**: Archived legal or medical documents accessed occasionally.

```json
"StorageClass": "GLACIER_IR"
```

---

## ✅ 6. S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval (formerly "Glacier")

- **Use**: Access within minutes to hours.
- Much lower cost.

📦 **Example**: Archived files for legal or tax compliance.

```json
"StorageClass": "GLACIER"
```

---

## ✅ 7. S3 Glacier Deep Archive

- **Lowest-cost** option with retrieval times up to **12 hours**.
- Best for **long-term archival** (minimum 180 days).

📦 **Example**: Historical data, long-term backups, audit logs.

```json
"StorageClass": "DEEP_ARCHIVE"
```

---

## ✅ 8. S3 Reduced Redundancy Storage (RRS) ❌ *Deprecated / Not recommended*

- Lower durability (99.99%) and redundancy.
- Not recommended for new data.

---

## 🔁 How to Set Storage Class

When uploading with AWS CLI or SDK, specify the storage class:

```bash
aws s3 cp file.txt s3://my-bucket/ --storage-class STANDARD_IA
```
