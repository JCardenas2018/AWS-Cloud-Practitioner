# AWS Well-Architected Framework â€“ The Six Pillars

The **AWS Well-Architected Framework** is built around **six key pillars** that help cloud architects design secure, high-performing, resilient, and efficient infrastructure for their applications.

---

## 1. **Operational Excellence**

**Goal**: Run and monitor systems to deliver business value and continually improve supporting processes and procedures.

**Best Practices**:
- Automate changes.
- Monitor metrics and logs.
- Prepare for and learn from failure.

---

## 2. **Security**

**Goal**: Protect data, systems, and assets through risk assessments and the implementation of mitigation strategies.

**Best Practices**:
- Implement the principle of least privilege.
- Protect data in transit and at rest.
- Automate security auditing and response.

---

## 3. **Reliability**

**Goal**: Ensure a system can recover from failures and meet customer demands by dynamically acquiring computing resources.

**Best Practices**:
- Design for automatic recovery from failure.
- Test recovery procedures regularly.
- Manage service quotas and limits.

---

## 4. **Performance Efficiency**

**Goal**: Use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements and to maintain efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve.

**Best Practices**:
- Select the right instance types.
- Monitor performance metrics.
- Scale horizontally and leverage serverless technologies where appropriate.

---

## 5. **Cost Optimization**

**Goal**: Avoid unnecessary costs and use resources efficiently to maximize business value.

**Best Practices**:
- Use Reserved Instances or Savings Plans.
- Shut down unused resources.
- Monitor and analyze costs using tools like AWS Cost Explorer.

---

## 6. **Sustainability** *(added in 2021)*

**Goal**: Minimize the environmental impacts of running cloud workloads.

**Best Practices**:
- Optimize resource usage.
- Choose energy-efficient regions.
- Design applications to use fewer resources.

By following these six pillars, architects can build and operate well-architected systems that deliver optimal business and technical outcomes in the AWS Cloud.
