## AWS Systems Manager

### Overview  
AWS Systems Manager is a fully managed service that gives you visibility and control over your AWS and on-premises infrastructure. It unifies operational data from multiple AWS services and automates tasks such as configuration management, patching, software deployment, and remote command execution, all without needing SSH or RDP access.

### Key Features  
- **Parameter Store**  
  - Secure hierarchical storage for configuration data and secrets, with optional AWS KMS encryption.  
- **Session Manager**  
  - Browser-based shell and RDP-style access to instances without opening inbound ports, fully audited via AWS CloudTrail.  
- **Run Command**  
  - Execute scripts or commands across fleets of instances at scale, with real-time feedback on success or failure.  
- **State Manager**  
  - Define desired state configurations (e.g., package installations, file updates) and have them automatically applied and maintained.  
- **Patch Manager**  
  - Automate OS patching for Windows and Linux instances using customizable patch baselines and maintenance windows.  
- **Automation**  
  - Create and run reusable, versioned workflows (runbooks) for complex operational tasks like AMI creation, backups, and instance reprovisioning.  
- **Inventory**  
  - Collect metadata about installed applications, OS configurations, and AWS components for auditing and compliance reporting.  
- **Maintenance Windows**  
  - Schedule recurring time slots for maintenance tasks (patching, state associations, run commands) to minimize disruption.  
- **Distributor**  
  - Package and deploy your own or third-party software to instances across environments.  
- **OpsCenter**  
  - Centralize operational issues (OpsItems) generated by alarms or automated workflows, track remediation progress, and assign responsibility.

### Common Use Cases  
- Centralized management of configuration data and secrets  
- Secure, audited access to instances without managing SSH keys or opening ports  
- Orchestrated patching, software deployments, and configuration enforcement  
- Continuous compliance and drift detection for instance configurations  
- Automated incident response workflows and runbook execution

### Pricing Model  
- **Parameter Store**  
  - Standard parameters: free up to 10,000 parameters.  
  - Advanced parameters: \$0.05 per parameter-per-month.  
  - API interactions beyond free tier: \$0.05 per 1,000 requests.  
- **Other Features (Run Command, State Manager, Patch Manager, Automation, Inventory, Session Manager, OpsCenter, Maintenance Windows, Distributor)**  
  - No additional software fees; you pay only for the underlying resources (EC2, Lambda invocations, S3 storage, CloudWatch Logs, etc.).

### Security & Compliance  
- **Encryption**  
  - Parameter Store and OpsCenter data encrypted with AWS KMS.  
- **Access Control**  
  - Fine-grained IAM policies for each Systems Manager capability.  
- **Audit & Logging**  
  - All actions and sessions are logged in AWS CloudTrail and CloudWatch Logs.  
- **Private Connectivity**  
  - Systems Manager can be accessed via VPC endpoints (AWS PrivateLink), keeping traffic off the public internet.

### Integrations  
- **Compute**: Amazon EC2 instances and on-premises servers (via the SSM Agent)  
- **Serverless**: AWS Lambda invoked from Automation documents or Run Command  
- **Monitoring**: AWS CloudWatch Metrics, Logs, and Events  
- **Compliance**: AWS Config for evaluating resource compliance  
- **Secrets Management**: AWS Secrets Manager as a backend for secure parameters  
- **Event-Driven**: Amazon EventBridge rules triggering SSM workflows

### Example: Run a Shell Script on Multiple Instances via CLI  
```bash
aws ssm send-command \
  --document-name "AWS-RunShellScript" \
  --instance-ids i-0123456789abcdef0 i-0fedcba9876543210 \
  --parameters commands=["sudo yum update -y","echo 'Patch complete'"] \
  --timeout-seconds 600 \
  --region us-east-1
