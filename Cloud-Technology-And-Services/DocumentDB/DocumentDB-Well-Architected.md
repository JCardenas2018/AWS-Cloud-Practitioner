# Amazon DocumentDB & AWS Well-Architected Framework (6 Pillars)

This document aligns Amazon DocumentDB best practices to each of the six AWS Well-Architected Framework pillars.

---

## 1. Operational Excellence

* **Infrastructure as Code**
  • Define clusters, instances, parameter groups, and security groups in CloudFormation or Terraform.
* **Automation & CI/CD**
  • Automate cluster provisioning and schema migrations via AWS CodePipeline or AWS CLI scripts.
* **Monitoring & Alerting**
  • Use CloudWatch metrics (ReadIOPS, WriteIOPS, CPUUtilization, FreeableMemory) and set alarms.
  • Capture API calls with CloudTrail for audit and troubleshooting.
* **Change Management**
  • Version parameter and option group changes; test in staging before production.

---

## 2. Security

* **Authentication & Access Control**
  • Use IAM authentication for MongoDB users; rotate AWS KMS keys regularly.
  • Enforce least privilege with fine-grained IAM policies and Security Groups.
* **Encryption**
  • Enable encryption at rest with AWS KMS CMKs.
  • Enforce TLS for all client connections; use ACM-managed certificates.
* **Network Isolation**
  • Deploy clusters in private subnets; use VPC endpoints to isolate traffic.
  • Restrict inbound access to trusted CIDR ranges only.
* **Auditing & Logging**
  • Enable slow-query logs and audit logs; store to CloudWatch Logs or S3.
  • Integrate with CloudTrail for configuration change history.

---

## 3. Reliability

* **High Availability**
  • Deploy clusters with at least three instances across multiple AZs.
  • Rely on automated failover; configure driver retry logic.
* **Backups & Recovery**

  • Schedule snapshots and use point-in-time recovery; test restore procedures regularly.
* **Fault Isolation**

  • Tag clusters by environment; limit blast radius by provisioning separate clusters for dev, test, prod.
* **Data Integrity**

  • Validate backups by performing test restores; enable data validation components if needed.

---

## 4. Performance Efficiency

* **Right-Size Instances**
  • Choose instance classes (db.r5, db.r6g) based on CPU/memory requirements; use Graviton (r6g) for cost-performance gains.
* **Scaling**
  • Scale read replicas out to handle read-heavy workloads; monitor replication lag.
* **Query Optimization**

  • Define appropriate indexes; avoid full collection scans.
  • Use projection and pagination to limit data transferred.
* **Monitoring & Tuning**

  • Leverage Performance Insights and CloudWatch to identify bottlenecks; adjust parameter groups accordingly.

---

## 5. Cost Optimization

* **Pricing Models**
  • Mix instance classes and read-replicas to balance cost and performance.
* **Storage Management**

  • Monitor storage utilization; delete unused collections and snapshots.
* **Snapshot Retention**

  • Implement lifecycle policies to clean up old snapshots.
* **Right-Sizing & Automation**

  • Automate scaling based on metrics; schedule off-peak instance reductions.

---

## 6. Sustainability

* **Efficient Resource Use**
  • Right-size clusters and replicas to actual workload demand; avoid over-provisioning.
* **Efficient Storage**

  • Archive infrequently accessed data; use TTL indexes to expire old documents.
* **Energy-Efficient Instances**

  • Adopt Graviton2-based instances (r6g) for lower power consumption.
* **Resource Cleanup**

  • Automate deletion of idle clusters and unused snapshots via AWS Backup and Lifecycle Manager.
