- **Contextual Recommendations**  
  Incorporate contextual metadata (season, device type, time of day) for more relevant results.  
- **AutoML & Automated Workflows**  
  Automatically selects and tunes the best algorithms based on your data.  
- **Batch & Real-Time Inference**  
  Generate recommendations in bulk for offline use or in real time for live applications.  
- **Event Tracking API**  
  Ingest user activity (impressions, clicks, purchases) to continuously update models.

### Common Use Cases  
- **E-Commerce**: “Customers who bought this also bought…”, frequently bought together, next-best offers.

### Pricing Model  
- **Training**  
  - Charged per hour of compute capacity used to train a recipe (algorithm variant).  
- **Inference**  
  - Charged per recommendation API call (real-time) or per thousand records (batch).  
- **Data Ingestion**  
  - Data import jobs billed per GB processed.  
- **No Upfront Fees**  
  - Pay-as-you-go, with no minimum commitments.

### Security & Compliance  
- **Encryption**  
  - All data at rest is encrypted using AWS KMS CMKs; in transit via HTTPS/TLS.  
- **Access Control**  
  - Fine-grained IAM policies to control access to datasets, campaigns, and API operations.  
- **VPC Integration**  
  - Private network access via VPC endpoints (AWS PrivateLink).  
- **Audit Logging**  
  - All API calls logged in AWS CloudTrail for governance and auditing.

### Integrations  
- **Event Streaming**: Amazon Kinesis Data Streams / Firehose for live event ingestion.  
- **Data Stores**: Amazon S3, Redshift, DynamoDB for initial dataset import.  
- **Analytics & BI**: AWS Glue, Amazon Athena, Amazon QuickSight to explore and visualize recommendation results.  
- **Application Backend**: AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway to serve recommendations in web/mobile apps.  

### Example: Create a Dataset Group & Import Data via AWS CLI  
```bash
# Create a dataset group
aws personalize create-dataset-group \
  --name MyRecommenderGroup

# Create and import a Users dataset
aws personalize create-dataset \
  --dataset-group-arn arn:aws:personalize:us-east-1:123456789012:dataset-group/MyRecommenderGroup \
  --dataset-type USERS \
  --schema-arn arn:aws:personalize:us-east-1:123456789012:schema/MyUsersSchema

aws personalize create-dataset-import-job \
  --job-name ImportUsersJob \
  --dataset-arn arn:aws:personalize:us-east-1:123456789012:dataset/MyUsers \
  --data-source dataLocation="s3://my-bucket/users.csv" \
  --role-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/PersonalizeImportRole
