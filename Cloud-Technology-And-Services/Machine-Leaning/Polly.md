## Amazon Polly

### Overview  
Amazon Polly is a fully managed Text-to-Speech (TTS) service that uses deep learning to synthesize natural-sounding speech from text. It offers dozens of lifelike voices across multiple languages and dialects, enabling you to add speech capabilities to applications, devices, and systems.

### Key Features  
- **Neural & Standard Voices**  
  - Over 70 voices in 30+ languages, including high-quality Neural TTS (NTTS) voices.  
- **SSML Support**  
  - Fine-grained control over pronunciation, speech rate, volume, pauses, and emphasis using Speech Synthesis Markup Language.  
- **Real-Time Streaming**  
  - Low-latency audio streaming for interactive applications.  
- **Audio Storage**  
  - Output formats include MP3, OGG, and PCM; easily store generated files in Amazon S3.  
- **Custom Pronunciations**  
  - Define lexicons or use SSML phoneme tags to adjust word pronunciations.  
- **Speech Marks**  
  - Get time-aligned metadata (word/phoneme timestamps) for subtitles, lip-sync, or graphics sync.

### Common Use Cases  
- **Virtual Assistants & Chatbots**  
  - Provide natural voice responses in conversational interfaces.  
- **IVR & Contact Centers**  
  - Build dynamic, spoken menus and prompts with realistic voices.  
- **Audiobooks & e-Learning**  
  - Automatically narrate text content for training, education, or accessibility.  
- **Accessibility**  
  - Generate audio for visually impaired users or hands-free applications.  
- **IoT & Embedded Devices**  
  - Power voice interactions on smart speakers, wearables, and in-car systems.

### Pricing Model  
- **Standard Voices**: \$4.00 per 1 million characters of text  
- **Neural (NTTS) Voices**: \$16.00 per 1 million characters of text  
- **No Upfront Fees**: Pay-as-you-go, no minimum commitments

### Security & Compliance  
- **Encryption**  
  - Data in transit secured via TLS; output files can be encrypted at rest using AWS KMS.  
- **Access Control**  
  - Fine-grained IAM policies to manage who can synthesize speech, manage lexicons, or access S3 outputs.  
- **VPC Endpoints**  
  - PrivateLink support for private connectivity without exposing traffic to the public internet.  
- **Certifications**  
  - HIPAA, SOC 1/2/3, ISO 27001, PCI DSS, GDPR, and more.

### Integrations  
- **AWS SDKs & CLI**  
  - Programmatic access from Java, Python, JavaScript, .NET, Go, Ruby, etc.  
- **Amazon S3**  
  - Store and serve generated audio files for on-demand playback.  
- **AWS Lambda**  
  - Dynamically synthesize speech in serverless workflows.  
- **Amazon Connect**  
  - Use Polly voices in IVR prompts and chatbots.

### Example: Synthesize Speech via AWS CLI  
```bash
aws polly synthesize-speech \
  --output-format mp3 \
  --voice-id Joanna \
  --text "Hello! This is a demonstration of Amazon Polly." \
  hello.mp3
