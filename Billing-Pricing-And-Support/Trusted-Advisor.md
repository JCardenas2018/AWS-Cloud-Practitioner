# AWS Trusted Advisor

**AWS Trusted Advisor** is an online tool that provides real-time guidance to help you provision your resources following AWS best practices. Trusted Advisor evaluates your AWS environment and makes recommendations in five categories.

## üîç Key Categories

1. **Cost Optimization**

   * Identify idle or underutilized resources (e.g., EC2 instances, EBS volumes).
   * Rightsize instances for lower cost.
2. **Performance**

   * Improve system performance (e.g., by optimizing instance families, load balancing).
   * Highlight opportunities to use newer, faster EC2 instance types.
3. **Security**

   * Detect security misconfigurations (e.g., open security groups, unrestricted IAM policies).
   * Recommend MFA on root account; check for exposed S3 buckets.
4. **Fault Tolerance**

   * Enhance reliability (e.g., enable Multi-AZ on RDS, automated backups for EBS).
   * Point out single points of failure in your architecture.
5. **Service Limits**

   * Monitor usage against AWS service quotas.
   * Alert when usage approaches limits to avoid interruptions.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Access

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to **Trusted Advisor** under the **AWS Support** menu.
3. View the **Dashboard** for a high-level summary.
4. Drill down into each category to see specific recommendations and impact.

## üìà Plan Integration

* **Basic & Developer**: Access a limited set of checks (Core Checks).
* **Business & Enterprise**: Full set of Trusted Advisor checks and programmatic access via the AWS Support API.

## üìö Example Checks and Use Cases

### Example 1: Idle EC2 Instances (Cost Optimization)

```text
- Check: EC2 instances with low CPU utilization
- Action: Stop or terminate instances to save on compute costs
```

**Use case**: A dev environment with forgotten test instances incurring charges.

### Example 2: Security Group Open to the World (Security)

```text
- Check: Security groups allowing 0.0.0.0/0 on ports 22 or 3389
- Action: Restrict traffic to known IP ranges
```

**Use case**: Hardening SSH access to bastion hosts.

### Example 3: Service Limit Approaching (Service Limits)

```text
- Check: RDS DB instances nearing account limit
- Action: Request a limit increase before hitting the quota
```

**Use case**: Scaling a database fleet for a seasonal traffic spike.

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

* **Review Regularly**: Check recommendations weekly or integrate alerts.
* **Automate Remediation**: Use AWS Lambda or Systems Manager to remediate routine issues.
* **Integrate with DevOps**: Include Trusted Advisor checks in CI/CD pipelines for continuous compliance.
* **Use Programmatic Access**: Leverage the AWS Support API to pull checks into dashboards or ticketing systems.
